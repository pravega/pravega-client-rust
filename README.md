# Rust client for Pravega

This is a native Rust client for [Pravega](https://www.pravega.io/). 

Note: Pravega 0.9.0+ is required.

## Status

The client is not yet feature complete and is currently under active development. It is not ready for production use, but is far enough along that it can be used for experimentation.

Up to date status can be seen on [the wiki](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-client-rust/wiki/Design-plan).

## Goals

The goal is to allow for clients to be written in Rust, as well as provide a common implementation for clients in higher level languages including Python and nodejs. 

See the wiki for the [status of each language](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-client-rust/wiki/Supported-APIs).

## Approach

The approach is to write a common native implementation of the internals of the client in Rust. Then use a C ABI to provide an interface for other languages to link against.

Finally for each supported language the low level API is translated into a high level API that is idiomatic for the language.
